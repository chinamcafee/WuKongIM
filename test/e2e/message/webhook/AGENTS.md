# message/webhook AGENTS

This scenario owns black-box webhook coverage for `cmd/wukongim`.

## Purpose

Prove single-node cluster post-commit notifications and three-node synchronous
msg.before_send admission through real WKProto, Product HTTP, committed history,
and an external HTTP endpoint. Cover payload mutation, business rejection,
independent timeout/error policies, transient sends, and one callback per ingress
attempt across authority forwarding. The authenticated fault test also checks
Token rejection, slow/unavailable/malformed/redirecting callbacks, per-node
overload isolation and recovery, callback counts, and public metric deltas.
`TestGoBeforeSendWebhookExample` builds the published Go example, owns its
separate process, and checks Product HTTP decisions and committed history in a
single-node cluster. Gateway Token auth stays enabled; explicit denial is also
checked with `on_error=allow`.

## Run

```bash
GOWORK=off go test -tags=e2e ./test/e2e/message/webhook -count=1 -timeout 2m -p=1
```

## Rules

- Keep assertions black-box through real `cmd/wukongim`, real WKProto SEND,
  and HTTP requests observed by the test webhook endpoint.
- Do not import `internal/app`, `internal/usecase`, or storage internals.
- Keep webhook waits bounded and include node diagnostics plus captured webhook
  requests on failure.

- The notification and admission tests explicitly disable Gateway Token
  authentication to isolate callback semantics. `TestBeforeSendWebhookAuthenticatedFaults`
  enables Token authentication on all three nodes, provisions test credentials
  through Product HTTP, and checks both valid cross-node sessions and invalid Tokens.
- The fault test uses 256 hash slots, two Slot replicas, a three-second callback
  timeout, and two in-flight calls per node. Node-specific failure policies are
  deliberate test fixtures; deployment configurations must remain consistent.
- Resource snapshots and a finite saturation burst are diagnostic evidence,
  not production capacity or leak qualification. Report absent CPU metrics as
  unavailable, never zero. Close test callbacks and all node processes on exit.
